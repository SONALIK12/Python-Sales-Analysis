The project aims to analyze sales data to uncover patterns, trends, and areas for potential improvement or optimization. The dataset includes details such as sales dates, product IDs, product categories, sales quantities, and sales amounts over a specified period. The analysis involves data cleaning (handling missing values, removing duplicates, ensuring consistency), descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, frequency counts), and data visualization (using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to visualize trends and distributions). Additional steps include feature engineering (creating new features, transforming variables), correlation analysis (examining relationships between variables), and outlier detection (identifying and handling outliers). Required Python libraries are NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and optionally, Plotly for interactive visualizations.
