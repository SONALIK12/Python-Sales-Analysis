# Sales-insights-using-Python
This repository contains the exploratory analysis of sales data performed using Python. The project aims to gain insights into the sales data and identify patterns, trends, and potential areas for improvement or optimization.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of sales data collected over a specific time period. It includes information such as:

Sales date
Product ID
Product category
Sales quantity
Sales amount
Exploratory Analysis
In this project, various exploratory data analysis techniques have been applied to understand the sales data better. The analysis includes but is not limited to:

Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values.
Removing duplicates.
Ensuring data consistency and integrity.
Descriptive Statistics:

Calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc., for numerical features.
Counting frequency of categorical variables.
Data Visualization:

Utilizing libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create visualizations.
Visualizing trends over time, sales distribution across different categories, and any other relevant patterns.
Creating histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and other plots to explore relationships between variables.
Feature Engineering:

Creating new features that might be helpful for further analysis.
Transforming variables if needed (e.g., converting categorical variables into numerical form).
Correlation Analysis:

Identifying correlations between different variables in the dataset.
Understanding how changes in one variable affect others.
Outlier Detection:

Identifying outliers that may skew the analysis.
Deciding on appropriate strategies to handle outliers (e.g., removing, transforming, or keeping them).
Requirements
To run the exploratory analysis code, you will need the following Python libraries:

-NumPy
-pandas
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn
-Plotly (optional, for interactive visualizations)
